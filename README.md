# Tagging-Time

Tagging time data is finally available now that we are using Labelbox platform.

Main motivation: evaluating the time it takes to tag according to different tagging instructions (e.g: emergence, weeds(broad/grass), emergence + weeds(broad/grass)).

Secondary motivation: finding actionable insights from the data about the tagging performance (e.g: outliers, under performance etc).

Data Sources:

Time per image - Labelbox API
Tagging instructions per image - ETI Data Base
Delivery Date, tagging team - Jira (Google Sheets extention)
